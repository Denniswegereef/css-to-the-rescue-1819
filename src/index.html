        A glitch is a short-lived fault in a system, such as a transient fault
        that corrects itself, making it difficult to troubleshoot. The term is
        particularly common in the computing and electronics industries, in
        circuit bending, as well as among players of video games. More
        generally, all types of systems including human organizations and nature
        experience glitches. A glitch, which is slight and often temporary,
        differs from a more serious software bug which is a genuine
        functionality-breaking problem. Alex Pieschel, writing for Arcade
        Review, said: "“bug” is often cast as the weightier and more blameworthy
        pejorative, while “glitch” suggests something more mysterious and
        unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs or stuff outside the realm of
        code."

        Another term we adopted to describe some of our problems was "glitch."
        Literally, a glitch is a spike or change in voltage in an electrical
        circuit which takes place when the circuit suddenly has a new load put
        on it. You have probably noticed a dimming of lights in your home when
        you turn a switch or start the dryer or the television set. Normally,
        these changes in voltage are protected by fuses. A glitch, however, is
        such a minute change in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.

        Glitches may include incorrectly displayed graphics, collision detection
        errors, game freezes/crashes, sound errors, and other issues. Graphical
        glitches are especially notorious in platforming games, where malformed
        textures can directly affect gameplay (for example, by displaying a
        ground texture where the code calls for an area that should damage the
        character, or by not displaying a wall texture where there should be
        one, resulting in an invisible wall). Some glitches are potentially
        dangerous to the game's stored data

        Some reference books, including Random House's American Slang, claim
        that the term comes from the German word glitschen ("to slip") and the
        Yiddish word gletshn ("to slide or skid"). Either way, it is a
        relatively new term. It was first widely defined for the American people
        by Bennett Cerf on the June 20, 1965 episode of What's My Line as "a
        kink... when anything goes wrong down there [Cape Kennedy], they say
        there's been a slight glitch." Astronaut John Glenn explained the term
        in his section of the book Into Orbit, writing that

      <p class="glitch-content__text-two">
        An electronics glitch or hazard is a transition that occurs on a signal
        before the signal settles to its intended value, particularly in a
        digital circuit. Generally this implies an electrical pulse of short
        duration, often due to a race condition between two signals derived from
        a common source but with different delays. In some cases, such as a
        well-timed synchronous circuit, this could be a harmless and
        well-tolerated effect that occurs normally in a design. In other
        contexts a glitch can represent an undesirable result of a fault or
        design error that can produce a malfunction. Some electronic components,
        such as flip-flops, are triggered by a pulse that must not be shorter
        than a specified minimum duration in order to function correctly; a
        pulse shorter than the specified minimum may be called a glitch. A
        related concept is the runt pulse, a pulse whose amplitude is smaller
        than the minimum level specified for correct operation, and a spike, a
        short pulse similar to a glitch but often caused by ringing or
        crosstalk.
